# Clear workspace
rm(list = ls())

# Load some packages
# (install them first! but only once)
library(tidyverse)

# Basic R syntax
n <- log2(8) # the log2 of 8
n # shortcut to print(n)

# PlantGrowth Case Study ----

# A built-in data set
data(PlantGrowth)

# Descriptive stats
# The "global mean", i.e. ANOVA Null hypothesis
mean(PlantGrowth$weight)

# group-wise stats (with dplyr)
# using tidyverse notation
# %>% "the pipe operator"
# say: "... and then ..."
PlantGrowth %>% 
  group_by(group) %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(weight),
            stdev = sd(weight))

# Data vis (with ggplot2)
# 3 essential components
# 1 - The data
# 2 - Aesthetics - mapping variables onto scales
# scales: x, y, color, size, shape, linetype
# 3 - Geometry - how the plot will look

# box plot
ggplot(PlantGrowth, aes(x = group, y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot()

# "dot plot"
ggplot(PlantGrowth, aes(x = group, y = weight)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.25, alpha = 0.5)

# Q-Q plot:
ggplot(PlantGrowth, aes(sample = weight)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line(color = "red") +
  facet_wrap(~ group, scales = "free_y")

# quick & dirty, but not separated
# qqnorm(PlantGrowth$weight)
# qqline(PlantGrowth$weight, col = "red")

# Inferential stats
# first step: define a linear model
# ~ means "described by"
plant_lm <- lm(weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth)
plant_lm

# PlantGrowth %>%
#   lm(weight ~ group, data = .)


# T-tests
# Typically, use t.test(), but here, we can use:
summary(plant_lm) # p-values are labelled Pr(>|t|)

# 1-way ANOVA
anova(plant_lm) # p-value 0.01591

# For all pair-wise comparisons: use 
# plant_aov <- aov(weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth)
# TukeyHSD(plant_aov)

# Element 2: Functions (verbs) ----
# Everything that happens, is because of a function

# Arithmetic operators
34 + 6

# BEDMAS - order of operations
# brackets, expon, div, mult, add, sub
2 - 3/4 # 1.25
(2 - 3)/4 # -0.25

# Use objects in place of numbers
n <- 34
p <- 6
# so...
n + p

# Generic functions have a form:
# fun_name(fun_arg = ...)

# Call args by name or position

# i.e.
log(x = 8, base = 2) # long form, naming
log(8, 2) # long form, positional matching
log(8, base = 2) # common: mix naming and position
log2(8) # short form, positional matching
log(base = 2, 8) # works, but confusing!

# Funs can have 0 to many un-named args
ls()
# Args can be named or un-named

# e.g. combine
xx <- c(3, 8, 9, 23)
xx

myNames <- c("healthy", "tissue", "quantity")
myNames

# How is + a function?
p + n
# this is actually...
`+`(p, n)

# A regular sequence of numbers
seq(from = 1, to = 100, by = 7)
# typically:
foo1 <- seq(1, 100, 7)
foo1

# use objects in functions:
foo2 <- seq(1, n, p)
foo2

# regular sequence of 1 interval
seq(1, 10, 1)
# Use the colon operator instead:
1:10

# Two major types of math functions:
# Aggregration functions
# 1 output value (typically)
# mean, sd, n, var, median, max, min, sum, prod

# Transformation functions
# same number of output as input
# log, [0,1], z-scores, sqrt, exponents
# subtract background
# +, -, /, ...

# Exercise: Are these transformation or aggregation?
foo2 + 100 # trans
foo2 + foo2 # trans
# foo2 %o% foo2 # trans
sum(foo2) + foo2 # agg, followed by trans
1:3 + foo2 # trans

# FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT: VECTOR RECYCLING

1:4 + foo2

# 3 types of messages:
# Information: Neutral
# Warning: Possible problem
# Error: Full stop

# Exercise: Calculate y = 1.12x âˆ’ 0.4 for xx
# i.e. y=mx+b
y <- (1.12 * xx) - 0.4

# Element 3: Objects (nouns) ----
# Anything that exists is an object

# Vectors - 1-dimensional, homogenous
# Everything in the values section
foo1
myNames

# 4 most common 
# "user-defined atomic vector types"
# Logical - TRUE/FALSE, T/F, 1/0 (Boolean)
# Integer - whole numbers
# Double - real numbers (float)
# Character - All values (string)

# Numeric - Generic reference to int or dbl

# check
typeof(foo1)
typeof(myNames)

foo3 <- c("Liver", "Brain", "Testes", "Muscle",
          "Intestine", "Heart")
typeof(foo3)

foo4 <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
typeof(foo4)

# Homogenous types:
test <- c(1:10, "bob")
test
typeof(test)

# We can't do math:
mean(test)

# R has a type hierarchy

# Solution: Coercion to another type
# use an as.*() function
test <- as.numeric(test)
test

# Now we can do math: but deal with the NA
mean(test, na.rm = TRUE)

# Lists - 1-dimensional, heterogenous
typeof(plant_lm)

# how many elements:
length(plant_lm)
length(foo1) # also works for vectors

# attributes (meta data)
attributes(plant_lm)
# 13 named elements

# use common "accessor" functions for attributes
names(plant_lm)

# Anything that's named can be called with $
plant_lm$coefficients # a 3-element named dbl (numeric) vector
plant_lm$residuals # a 30-element dbl vector
plant_lm$model # dataframe

# Add comment as metadata:
comment(plant_lm) <- "I love R so much!"
attributes(plant_lm)

# Add comment as an actual list item:
plant_lm$myComment <- "But python not so much :/"
plant_lm$myComment

# What is class?
# An attribute to an object
attributes(plant_lm)
# can also access with "accessor" function:
class(plant_lm)
# class tells R functions what to do with this object
# e.g.
summary(plant_lm) # get t-test and ANOVA summary from an "lm"
summary(PlantGrowth) # summarise each column in a "dataframe"

# Dataframes - 2-dimensional, heterogenous
class(PlantGrowth)
# A special class of type list...
typeof(PlantGrowth)
# ...where each element is a vector of the SAME length!
# Rows = observations
# Columns = variables

# Make a data frame from scratch:
foo_df <- data.frame(foo4, foo3, foo2)
foo_df

# update metadata (names)
names(foo_df) <- myNames
foo_df

# Call each variable by name:
foo_df$quantity # as a vector

# Basic functions:
str(foo_df) # structure
glimpse(foo_df)
summary(foo_df)

# also...
dim(foo_df)
nrow(foo_df)
ncol(foo_df)

# Element 4: Logical Expressions ----
# Asking and combining TRUE/FALSE questions
# Asking: Relational operators Table 9.1
# == equivalency
# != non-equivalency
# >, <, >=, <=
# !x, where x is a logical vector, give the negation of x

# Combining: Logical operators
# & AND - ALL must be TRUE
# | OR "pipe" - AT LEAST ONE must be TRUE
# %in% WITHIN

## Number one thing to remember:
## You will ALWAYS get a logical vector

# Examples with foo_df
# Logical data
# All healthy observations
foo_df %>% 
  filter(healthy)

# All unhealthy observations
foo_df %>% 
  filter(!healthy)

# Numeric data
# Below quantity 10
foo_df %>% 
  filter(quantity < 10)

# Tails (beyond 10 and 20)
foo_df %>% 
  filter(quantity < 10 | quantity > 20)

# Impossible
foo_df %>% 
  filter(quantity < 10 & quantity > 20)

# Middle (between 10 and 20)
foo_df %>% 
  filter(quantity > 10 & quantity < 20)

# Meaningless
foo_df %>% 
  filter(quantity > 10 | quantity < 20)

# What really happened
# We asked two questions:
foo_df$quantity > 10 & foo_df$quantity < 20

# Character data
# NO PATTERN MATCHING so we have to use exact matches
# All heart observations
foo_df %>% 
  filter(tissue == "Heart")

# All heart and liver observations
# Cheap and easy way:
foo_df %>% 
  filter(tissue == "Heart" | tissue == "Liver")

# What if... our query was in a vector?
query <- c("Heart", "Liver")
# %in% is the equivalent of many == combined with |
foo_df %>% 
  filter(tissue %in% query)

# to compare, NEVER DO THIS!!!
# This doesn't work:
foo_df %>% 
  filter(tissue == query)
# But this does: i.e. reverse the query
foo_df %>% 
  filter(tissue == rev(query))

# Element 5: Indexing ----
# Finding information by position using []

# Vectors (1-dimensional)
foo1
foo1[6] # The 6th element
foo1[p] # The pth element
foo1[3:p] # The 3rd to the pth element
foo1[p:length(foo1)] # the pth to the last element
foo1[-(11:15)] # remove using - (e.g. 11 - 15th element)
foo1[-c(11,15)] # remove using - (e.g. 11 & 15th element)

# We can use integers, object and functions that
# equate to integers in any combination!

# BUT!!! The exciting part is... using LOGICAL VECTORS
# I.E. THE RESULT OF LOGICAL EXPRESSIONS! (see above)

foo1[foo1 < 45] # All values less than 45

# Data frames (2-dimensional)
# so use [ <rows> , <cols> ] 
foo_df[3,] # The 3rd row, all columns (DATAFRAME)
foo_df[,3] # The 3rd column, all rows (VECTOR)
foo_df[3]  # The 3rd column, all rows (DATAFRAME)
foo_df$quantity

# What happens if we have a tibble?
foo_df <- as_tibble(foo_df)
class(foo_df)
foo_df
# now there are both kept as dataframes!
foo_df[,3]
foo_df[3]

# We can also used names:
foo_df[,"healthy"]

# but don't forget logical vectors:
# e.g. which tissues have low quantity (below 10)?
foo_df[foo_df$quantity < 10, "tissue"]
# This also works, as a vector:
foo_df$tissue[foo_df$quantity < 10]

# Which is exactly the same as:
foo_df %>% 
  filter(quantity < 10) %>% 
  select(tissue)

# Element 6: Factor Variables (with levels) ----
# i.e. Categorical, qualitative, discrete variables
# with a number of "groups"

# i.e. A small and known number of discrete groups

glimpse(PlantGrowth)
# Notice that the levels are printed:
PlantGrowth$group

typeof(PlantGrowth$group) # integer
class(PlantGrowth$group) # factor
# Factor is a special class of type integer
# Where each integer is associated with a label call "level"

# e.g.
str(PlantGrowth)

# Main problem:
# doing math on factors and coercion
test <- c(23:26, "bob")
test
# When we make a data frame chr become fct
test_df <- data.frame(test)
test_df$test

foo3
foo_df$tissue

# But tibbles won't switch types:
test_tb <- tibble(test)
test_tb$test

# But if you do have a factor, coercion is difficult
mean(test_df$test)
# Solution: 
as.numeric(test_df$test) # no!
# First coerce to chr
as.numeric(as.character(test_df$test))

# Change levels easily:
levels(PlantGrowth$group)[1] <- "Control"
PlantGrowth

# Element 7: Tidy data with tidyr ----

# Get a play data set:
source("PlayData.R")

# Let's see the scenarios we discussed in class:
# Scenario 1: Transformation height & width
PlayData$height/PlayData$width

# For the other scenarios, tidy data would be a 
# better starting point:
# we'll use gather()
# 4 arguments
# 1 - data
# 2,3 - key,value pair - i.e. name for OUTPUT
# 4 - the ID or the MEASURE variables

# using ID variables ("exclude" using -)
gather(PlayData, "key", "value", -c("type", "time"))

# using MEASURE variables
PlayData_t <- gather(PlayData, "key", "value", c("height", "width"))

# Scenario 2: Transformation across time 1 & 2
# difference from time 1 to time 2 for each type and key
# we only want one value as output
PlayData_t %>% 
  group_by(type, key) %>% 
  summarise(change = value[time == 2] - value[time == 1])

# or...
PlayData_t %>% 
  spread(time, value) %>% 
  mutate(change = `2` - `1`)

# standardize to time 1
PlayData_t %>% 
  group_by(type, key) %>% 
  mutate(stand = value/value[time == 1])

# Scenario 3: Transformation across type A & B
# A/B for each time and key
PlayData_t %>% 
  group_by(time, key) %>% 
  summarise(change = value[type == "A"] / value[type == "B"])
  
PlayData_t %>% 
  spread(type, value) %>% 
  mutate(change = A/B)
  
# Element 8: dplyr overview ----

# Scenario 1: Aggregation across height & width
PlayData_t %>% 
  group_by(type, time) %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(value))

# Scenario 2: Aggregation across time 1 & time 2
PlayData_t %>% 
  group_by(type, key) %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(value))

# Scenario 3: Aggregation across type A & type B
PlayData_t %>% 
  group_by(key, time) %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(value))
